I took education loan from Punjab national bank in year 2009 for pursuing B.Tech Graduate Program from Lovely Professional University. I completed this course in Year 2013 and repayment of loan started from 2014. 

As i was covered under Central Scheme for Interest Subsidy (CSIS) by Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD). Under the Scheme, the interest payable on the Educational Loan for the moratorium period i.e., Course Period plus one year as will be borne by the Government of India.
